# STA304 Final Project: Exploring Foreign Language Education
Spaced-repetition is noteable for being an efficient way for memorization and is used to great effect in many education apps including in Duolingo. This project seeks to investigate the efficacy of spaced-repetition in second-language education.

# Overview
This repo contains the RProject used to analyze the Duolingo dataset through logistic regression. It contains samples of 13 million users and their interactions with the Duolingo platform along with logs of their performance. We also include a report detailing our methodology and analysis, along with our findings. The research completed by the team at Duolingo can be found here https://github.com/duolingo/halflife-regression.
